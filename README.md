# Bonobo

A quick-and-dirty HTML5/JS prototype of interactive comics, built during the [#PrintisNotDead](http://printisnotdead.tumblr.com/) 2-day hackathon that took place on Feb 22-24, 2013.

The final project included an actual paper comic strip. Interactions between the player and the strip were realized using an Arduino module.

Depending on the motivation (and if we find some interested people), we might dig into the project beyond the hackathon. Or we might not.

A video of the project might also appear someday...

## Usage

The Arduino module was added to map some keystrokes. Without Arduino, you can use these:
* `N`: Get on board! (I mean, start the reading...)
* `W`: Wind sequence (`SPACE` to generate some wind)
* `X`: Mermaid sequence (`A`, `Z` and `E` to play the notes)
* `C`: Kraken sequence ('SPACE' to hit the Kraken)
* `B`: Reef sequence (`A` to go left, `Z` to go right)
* `Q`: Cave sequence (`S` to turn on the light)
* `V`: Treasure sequence (`SPACE` to dig in the sand)
